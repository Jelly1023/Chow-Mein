1. Hakka Noodles – Use any Indian brand of Hakka Noodles. I have used Ching’s Hakka Noodles. Note that these noodles is made with all-purpose flour so if you prefer a healthier version, then use whole wheat noodles or soba noodles (buckwheat noodles)

2. Veggies: You can add veggies of your choice. Mushroom give a meaty texture and umami flavor. If you do not like mushrooms you can skip them. You can choose from the following list of veggies:
cabbage (green or red)
carrots
french beans (green beans)
zucchini
broccoli
button mushrooms or cremini mushrooms
capsicum (bell pepper)
spring onions (scallions) or regular onions

3. Soy sauce: Try to use naturally fermented soy sauce as it gives a lovely fermented taste and flavor to the noodles. You can even use bragg liquid aminos or tamari instead.

4. Toasted sesame oil – The noodles get a lovely hint of smokiness from toasted sesame oil. But do not worry if you do not have toasted sesame oil. Just use any other neutral tasting oil like sunflower oil or safflower oil.

5. Herbs and spices: Garlic, dry red chillies, celery or coriander leaves (cilantro) are the herbs and spices added. Celery is not available everywhere in India. So if you do not have celery, then just skip it. Use green chillies instead of dry red chillies.

6. Rice vinegar: Instead of rice vinegar you can add white vinegar or apple cider vinegar. You can even use rice wine or mirin. Both rice vinegar and rice wine give a distinct flavor and aroma to the dish.
